subtitle: A journey seeing the world thru data
---

My name is Tony Tia, a data scientist that speaks for the data because data can't speak for themselves. Many data has been collected from systems, services and customers. I focused on helping professional service firms and tech startup understand their customers and recommend the right decisions. I specialize in recommender systems, natural language processing and deploying machine learning models with user interface.

Have been an application builder programmer and a consumer of the application, taught me insights on customer interactions with computers. And now with as data scientist, I help build machine learning models computer to better interact with customers.
