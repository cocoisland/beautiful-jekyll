I studied and practised big data science from Lambda School. Prior to studying at Lambda School, I have been a Java programmer, database administrator and system administrator.

Big data, data science, machine learning, as they are the many names of the same or very similar things, are some of the subjects which I studied and done projects on, at Lambda School. Listed on the website, are some of the past projects that formed my foundation as big data science student.
