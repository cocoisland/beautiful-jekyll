## Can you avoid bad Airline ?
Fear of flying is understandable because  air travelling, put you in an uncontrollable situation. 
When air plane accident crashes,  it goes into headline news. Headline news solidified people suspicions into belief system. 
Eventually people think it is common sense to avoid airline with bad fatal accidents. 

### Strategy 1: Avoid airline with high fatalities accidents.

Comparing all bad news headline fatalities airlines during 1985-1999 with 2000-2014, the prior unfortunate airlines no longer had bad accidents. Instead a new set of prior no accident airlines had bad, showed up as bad news headline fatalities airlines in 2000-2014 period. 
* Airline fatalities crashes are rare and non-recurring. Rare accidents are unpredictable

## Avoid accident prone Airlines?
If non-recurring accidents are unpredictable, then avoiding airlines with bad record of high accident incidents, make better sense.

### Strategy 2: Avoid bad airline with highest bad past accident records

Comparing top major airlines with highest accidents from period 1985-1999 to 2000-2014, most of the prior accident prone airlines 
showed up in the latter period. However upon closer examination, these major airlines shared a commonality which was servicing high traffic airports
* Top accident airlines commonality are major airline flown in and out of major busy airport.
* Higher rate of passengers travelled and flight flown, higher rate of accident incidents

### The need to normalize data and then compare
Combine the three measures of crash rates — incidents, fatal accidents and fatalities — into a single measure and call it as airline’s safety score. Calculate it as follows:

For each category, subtract an airline’s crash rate from the average for all airlines since 1985. This gives safer airlines positive scores and less safe airlines negative scores.

Multiply the result by the square root of the number of seat kilometers flown. This gives more credit to an airline that has achieved a strong safety record over a larger sample of flights.

Standardize the score in each category to calculate how many standard deviations an airline is above or below the mean. Then average the scores from the three categories together. This is the safety score.
