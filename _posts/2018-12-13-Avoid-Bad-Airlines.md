Fear of flying is understandable because  air travelling put you in an uncontrollable situation. 
When air plane fell down from the sky,  high fatalities resulted and it went into headline news. People tends to remember this fear for a long time. Naturally it seems to make good sense to avoid airline with bad fatal accidents.

### Strategy 1: Avoid airline with high fatalities accidents.

![Headline Airline crashed](https://cocoisland.github.io/img/headline_crashed.png)

Airlines with high fatal accidents showed up in upper right quadrant of the graph.
From 1985-1999 there were more fatal accidents than 2000-2014. However each fatal accident still resulted in high number of fatalities. These fatal accidents stayed in people memory.

The high fatalities airlines in 85-99 that we feared and avoided, did not show up in 2000-2014 except China Airlines.

Chances of same airline crashes are rare and seldom repeated. 
* Airline fatalities crashes are rare and non-recurring. 
* Rare accidents are unpredictable and random.

If fatal accidents are non-recurring and random, then avoiding accident prone Airlines.

### Strategy 2: Avoid bad airline with highest bad past accident records

Common US major airlines with high accidents and accident related fatalites showed up in upper right quadrant.

14 years later 2000-2014, almost the same US major airlines had the same accident performance. However the number of accident related fatalities greatly dropped. May be due to better landing gear or food served on plane. No one know.

Upon closer examination these common US major airlines all served high traffic busy airport. Higher traffic of transporting passengers and more flight flown, naturally resulted in higher incident of accidents.
* Top accident airlines commonality are major airline flown in and out of major busy airport.
* Higher rate of passengers travelled and flight flown, resulted in higher accident incidents rate.

These high accident incidents records did not indicate these busy airlines as accident prone, but a natural outcome of high traffic servicing airlines.

Hence the need to normalize accident data because airline sizes and flight traffic are all different from each other. Normalizing all the differences between different airlines, resulted in a Safety Index which can be used to objectively compare different airline safety performance.

### Normalize data in order to compare objectively
Combine the three measures of crash rates — incidents, fatal accidents and fatalities — into a single measure and call it as airline’s safety score. Calculate it as follows:
* subtract an airline’s crash rate from the average for all airlines. This gives safer airlines positive scores and less safe airlines negative scores.
* Multiply the result by the square root of the number of seat kilometers flown. This gives more credit to an airline that has achieved a strong safety record over a larger sample of flights.
* Standardize the score in each category to calculate how many standard deviations an airline is above or below the mean. Then average the scores from the three categories together. 
* This is the safety score.

### Strategy 3: Normalized accidents by airline traffic into Safety Index and compare.

![Negative Safety Index](https://cocoisland.github.io/img/negative_safety_index.png)

Airline with most negative Safety Index showed up in lower left quadrant.

The above Safety Index chart showed airlines with most negative score measured over 30 years from 1998 - 2014.
Positive Safety Index indicates airlines with good safety performance. Negative Safety Index indicates airlines with more accient prone performance.

It turned out that all these negative Safety Index airlines, are airlines that we flown everday without any thought or concern for safety. On the other hand, all the airlines that we thought were dangerous and to be avoided, do not showed up as most negative or even positive in the Safety Index scale.

### Conclusion
It is easy to be misled by fear of airline accident especially when the fear is enforced by headline news. So the next time you plan to fly or have fear of flying, remember to use a Safety Index to guide your decision.
