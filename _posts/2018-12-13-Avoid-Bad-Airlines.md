## Can you avoid bad Airline ?
Fear of flying is understandable because  air travelling, put you into an uncontrollable situation. 
When air plane accident crashes,  it goes into headline news. Headline news solidified people presumption of their belief. 
It becomes common sense to avoid airline with bad fatal accidents. 

### Strategy 1: Avoid airline with high fatalities accidents.

## Avoid accident prone Airlines?
Airline fatalities crashes are rare and rarely happen repeatedly. Rare accidents are unpredictable. Hence avoiding airlines with bad record of high accident incidents, make better sense.

### Strategy 2: Avoid bad airline with highest bad past accident records

### 14 years later, same major Airlines had the same highest bad past accidents as before
After 14 years, followed up checking on airline with highest bad past accidents records in previous 14 years periods.

* Four out of the last top seven highest bad record holders, repeated among the new seven top bad accident airlines. The past highest bad accident airlines continued after 14 years period, were (American, Delta/Northwest, United/Continental, US Airways/America West and Ethiopian Airlines).

* The exceptions were two of the last top seven accidents airlines (Aeroflot, China Airline ) went from top to low accident airline.

### Not all repeated offenders repeat offences or are there other reasons.

* Fatalities by Airlines are rare and even rarer when happened repeatedly.  Highly unpredictable.
* Top accident airlines commonality are major airline flown in and out of major busy airport.
* Higher rate of passengers travelled and flight flown, higher rate of accident incidents

### Normalize data and then compare
Let’s combine the three measures of crash rates — incidents, fatal accidents and fatalities — into a single measure and call it as airline’s safety score. Calculate it as follows:

For each category, subtract an airline’s crash rate from the average for all airlines since 1985. This gives safer airlines positive scores and less safe airlines negative scores.

Multiply the result by the square root of the number of seat kilometers flown. This gives more credit to an airline that has achieved a strong safety record over a larger sample of flights.

Standardize the score in each category to calculate how many standard deviations an airline is above or below the mean. Then average the scores from the three categories together. This is the safety score.
