This article is an assortment of algorithm concept that are important for all critical applications.

Say on an embedded computer with very limited RAM, memory is extremely constrained and you are only allowed to store names in arrays. The challenge is to optimize a O(n^2) program, [names.py](https://github.com/cocoisland/Sprint-Challenge--Data-Structures-Python/names/names.py) . I managed to solve the problem with O(1) time and O(n) space complexities in [namesDict.py](https://github.com/cocoisland/Sprint-Challenge--Data-Structures-Python/names/nameDict.py)
