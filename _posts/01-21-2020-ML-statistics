what is the mean of a regression
coefficient of regression

what is ML regression
best fit line around residual wrapped within confidence interval
  residual is the prediction of ML model.

what is confidence interval
standard deviation around the mean of population 
  margin of error = z-score * sigma (standard deviation of population) / number of samples
  
standard error around the mean of sample population
  margin of error = t-score * standard error (standard deviation of sample population) / number of samples.
  
what is confidence interval used for?
To answer question like 
How many cup of coffee drank a day in the city. 1 to 4 cups on average per day. 
  But with 95% confidence, plus or minus x cup a day.
    mean taken from sample survey +/- t-score * standard error of sample population / sample size.
    
How many cup of coffee drank a day in this group of 100 people.
  With 95% confidence, + / - x cups a day by this group of 100 people.
    mean from 100 people survey +/- z-score * standard deviation of this 100 people / 100
