Melody Interpolator is a deep learning model being built using several LSTM layers to train on classical snippets and generate new melodies based on composersâ€™ melodies. The purpose of the application is to investigate how well artificial intelligence generated music be received by human listening experience.

The project needed a frontend application to house all our generated songs. I volunteered to learn React programming on my own in two weeks and with guidance from my Project manager, we built the frontend application to display the generated song files which were hosted on Contentful website. Using API calls, Contentful website delivered the generated song files as json object to my React application which then extracted and displayed on UI-material cards objects. I then used ToneJS midi library to implement the play and stop functionalities, so that the React application become user-friendly to play music. As generated midi melodies sounded harsh if unrendered, we rendered to the generated midi melodies into mp3. Even though we are very much living in a digital world, our Human listening experiences are still more attune to smooth analog wave sound than harsh digital sound. Hence by converting digital song files to analog mp3 song files, greatly improved listening experience.

The application backend was built by our team member who used AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting processed supported files. The backend gives users the option to select different flavor composer style song to be built. The raw output created will be in raw unrendered midi format.
